Project statement:
web application that works like a public notice board
1) on the "Login" page, ask the user to enter  a username and submit. The username should contain only alphanumerical characters.
2)On successful submission take the user to the "Notice Board " page. This page consists of a text area to enter any text  of 100   characters+ submit button,  followed by a list of notices from all users (similar to Facebook or Twitter feed).
3)Once the user submits a new notice, it appears along with notices from other users, latest first.
4)Each notice contains the notice text, the username and the date of submission.
5)All communications with the backend should be via REST APIs (not form submission);
